# Voxtype voice-to-text keybindings for Sway
# Place in /etc/sway/config.d/97-voxtype.conf
#
# Push-to-talk: Hold the hotkey while speaking, release to transcribe
#
# Default: Scroll_Lock (dedicated key, no conflicts)
# Alternative: HOME key (convenient on some keyboards)
#
# Simple mode (works without binding mode):
# bindsym --no-repeat $key exec voxtype record start
# bindsym --release $key exec voxtype record stop
#
# Advanced mode (with Escape to cancel):

set $voxtype_key Scroll_Lock

# Start recording on key press, enter voxtype mode
bindsym --no-repeat $voxtype_key exec voxtype record start; mode voxtype

mode voxtype {
    # Stop recording on key release
    bindsym --release $voxtype_key exec voxtype record stop; mode default

    # Cancel with Escape (discards audio, no transcription)
    bindsym Escape exec voxtype record cancel; mode default
}
