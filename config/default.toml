# Use "auto" for default location ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voxtype/state),

# Required for `voxtype record toggle` and `voxtype status` commands.

[hotkey]
# Built-in hotkey using evdev (Linux input subsystem)
#
# Most users should leave this disabled and use compositor keybindings instead:
#   - Hyprland: bind/bindr in hyprland.conf
#   - Sway: bindsym --no-repeat/--release in config
#   - River: riverctl map / map -release
#
# Enable this if you're on X11, using a compositor without key-release support,
# or prefer a dedicated key like ScrollLock. Requires 'input' group membership.

# [output.post_process]
# Pipe transcribed text through an external command for cleanup before output.

# On any failure (timeout, error), falls back to original transcription.
